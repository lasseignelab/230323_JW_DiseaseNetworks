## Purpose

**The purpose of this research is to investigate the tissue-specific
expression and regulatory landscape of human *SETBP1* in GTEx tissues**
This repository contains the code and accompanying data for our analysis
of the tissue-specific expression and regulation of transcription factor
(TF) *SETBP1* across 31 non-diseased human tissues part of the
Genotype-tissue expression project (GTEx). This project is hypothesis
generating, therefore emphasizing the role of different contexts, such
as tissues, and the role they may play in disease when a variant is
introduced.

*However, this code can be adapted and applied to other genes or TFs.*

## Dependencies and Resources

This analysis was carried out in Docker using R version 4.1.3. TF
activity inference using [decoupleR](), [PANDA]() tissue-specific
regulatory network generation, and tissue-specific edge identification
were run using the Docker on UABâ€™s high performance computing Cluster.
Bash scripts including resources used are included in this repository.
The containers have been made publicly available on Zenodo:
